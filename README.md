Peer Evaluation Website<br/>

## Description<br/>

A Peer Assessment System for university team projects is designed to allow students to evaluate the contributions and performance of their teammates based on four key dimensions:<br/>
cooperation, conceptual contribution, practical contribution, and work ethic. <br/>
The system promotes accountability and provides valuable feedback to both students and instructors on team dynamics and individual efforts.<br/>

We identify two primary users: Students and Instructors.<br/>

## System Features:<br/>
1.	Students assessment:<br/>
   -Students log into the system and are prompted to evaluate each of their teammates at the end of a project or key milestones.<br/>
   -Evaluation is conducted anonymously to encourage honest and constructive feedback.<br/>
   -Students rate their peers on a 7-point scale for each of the four dimensions, along with optional comment sections for detailed feedback.<br/>

2.	Automated Score Sharing and Anonymous Peer Feedback<br/>
   -After submission, individual scores are aggregated, and the instructor receives an overall assessment of each studentâ€™s performance.<br/>
   -Peer feedback is also shared with the students anonymously, helping them improve their performance in future projects.<br/>

4.	Instructor Dashboard:<br/>
   -Instructors have access to a dashboard that allows them to create teams, and at the end of an evaluation to show detailed peer assessment results by team, by student, and a summary of results. The results can be exported for further use as CSV file.<br/>
